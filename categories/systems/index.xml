      <description>Some time ago I saw an alert in our monitoring, The alert notified that production MySQL/Percona server had less than 10% of disk space left.
I was worried and curious - where did a 300 GB of free space go? And started to investigate the issue.
I found huge MySQL temporary table on the disk.
Issue was fixed by restarting MySQL server (temporary table become small again).
Incident was serious enough to have a post-mortem.</description>
